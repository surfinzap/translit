# translit â€” Rusyn transliteration

Rusyn language is written in Cyrillic script. If you lack a proper keyboard or an extra software, writing in Rusyn can take a while.

Translit is a javascript library to transliterate Rusyn language from Latin alphabet to Cyrillic script and vice versa. You can write your text in Latin alphabet and then transliterate it automatically.
