# translit â€” Rusyn transliteration

Rusyn language is written in cyrillic script. If you lack proper keyboard, or extra software, writting in Rusyn can be tedious.
We have written simple script to transliterate Rusyn language from latin alphabet to cyrillic script and vica versa. 

Feel free to either use the script as it is or you can try the transliteration in the browser at http://translit.tota.sk.
