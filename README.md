# translit â€” Rusyn transliteration

Rusyn language is written in Cyrillic script. If you lack a proper keyboard or extra software, writing in Rusyn can take a while. Translit is a javascript script to transliterate Rusyn language from Latin alphabet to Cyrillic script and vice versa. You can write your text in Latin alphabet and then transliterate it automatically.


## Usage
Feel free to either use the script as it is or try the transliteration at [translit.tota.sk](http://translit.tota.sk).
